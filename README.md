# PlayerPing
Spigot Minecraft Server plugin for displaying player's ping times on the player list

Tested working on: PaperMC 1.18 & 1.18.1

## Known issues
* As it stands, if the plugin is disabled/unloaded while the server is still running the player's ping times will still be shown on the player list with their last update values. The plugin is likely *not* reload-safe at the moment.
